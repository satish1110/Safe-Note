# Safe-Note
It is very common for people to make note of their passwords and security pins and keep it safely.  But there is always a chance for them to be misplaced or misused. This application is designed to keep them safe and secure. The key for this application is not through passwords but through a series of security questions. The user can set his/her own security questions and answers and also define the number of such security questions required to access this application. Then the user is allowed to enter a plaintext (password/pin) and choose an image. The plaintext is encrypted using AES algorithm and safely encoded within the image using LSB steganography algorithm. The encryption key will be derived from the security questions and their answers. The user can store any number of such plaintexts (usually one pin/password per image). To ensure global availability, a cloud storage can be used, in which the user-details and stegano images are stored and accessed through this application.
